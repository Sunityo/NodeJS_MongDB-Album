Opening the server to allow a connection to happen
To open the mongoDB server, you first need to access the command prompt and locate the file location where MongoDB is installed.

This will change the directory to the mongoDB directory. You then type in “CD bin” which will enter the bin folder in the mongoDB directory

Once this is done, you then type in this command:

This will run the server, which will allow you to connect to the dataset on mongoDB. The server should be running on port 27017 on the localhost.

Accessing the mongoDB dataset via command prompt 
We then run mongo.exe in the same bin directory

After this we type in “use albumstore”, and it should say we are in that database.


This command will show the data in the database in a pretty json format, so you can see the data easily.
